NERO-Pay Mini
NERO-Pay Mini Logo
A decentralized, walletless P2P payment solution on NERO Chain
Welcome to NERO-Pay Mini, a cutting-edge decentralized application (dApp) built to revolutionize peer-to-peer (P2P) payments using NERO Chain's Account Abstraction and Paymaster features. Inspired by Stripe's simplicity, this app enables users to send stablecoins or tokens with just a phone number or email, offering a seamless Web3 experience for both crypto natives and newcomers. With a sleek, animated UI and social login integration, NERO-Pay Mini is poised to onboard the next billion users into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
What It Does
NERO-Pay Mini transforms P2P payments by:
Allowing walletless transactions with social login (e.g., Web3Auth) and auto-created abstracted wallets.
Supporting gas-free payments (Type 0) via NERO's Paymaster, with options for prepay (Type 1) or postpay (Type 2) using tokens.
Enabling payments via phone/email, mimicking Web2 ease, while leveraging NERO Chain's infrastructure.
Featuring a polished, animated interface with dynamic token selection and transaction status feedback.
The Problem It Solves
Accessibility Barrier: Traditional blockchain payments require wallets and gas fees, deterring non-Web3 users.
Complexity: Managing private keys and gas costs confuses newcomers, limiting DeFi adoption.
Friction: Lack of intuitive, familiar payment methods hinders mass blockchain uptake.
NERO-Pay Mini bridges Web2 and Web3, offering a Stripe-like experience with decentralized security and flexibility.
Features
Walletless Onboarding: Social login creates AA wallets instantly.
Multiple Payment Types: Sponsored (free), prepay, and postpay options.
Token Flexibility: Dynamically fetch and select supported tokens.
Animated UI: Built with Framer Motion for a delightful user experience.
Real-Time Feedback: Transaction statuses and toast notifications.
Cross-Device Compatibility: Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
Blockchain: ethers.js, NERO Chain (Testnet), Account Abstraction, Paymaster API
Authentication: Web3Auth for social login
Utilities: viem, react-toastify
Build Tools: Vite (recommended) or react-scripts (current setup)
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16.x or v18.x recommended)
npm (v8.x or v9.x)
Git
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nero-pay-mini.git
cd nero-pay-mini
Install Dependencies
Ensure a clean setup by removing existing dependencies:
bash
npm uninstall tailwindcss react-scripts typescript @web3auth/modal viem ethers --save
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
Install required packages:
bash
npm install typescript@4.9.5 --save-dev
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss@3.4.17 postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npm install react-scripts@5.0.1
npm install ethers@6.13.4 @web3auth/modal@latest viem@2.31.3
Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:
REACT_APP_PAYMASTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_aa_platform
REACT_APP_NERO_RPC_URL=https://rpc-testnet.nerochain.io
REACT_APP_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_web3auth_client_id
Initialize Tailwind CSS
bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
Update tailwind.config.js with the provided theme (see src/tailwind.config.js).
Start the Development Server
bash
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
Alternative: Migrate to Vite
For a modern setup, consider using Vite:
Reinitialize with:
bash
npm create vite@latest nero-pay-mini -- --template react-ts
cd nero-pay-mini
npm install
Move src, public, and .env files, then install dependencies with typescript@5.8.3.
Update vite.config.ts and run:
bash
npm run dev
How We Built It
Started with a React TypeScript base, integrating Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations.
Developed core payment logic using ethers.js and NERO Chain’s Account Abstraction, with Paymaster handling gas fees.
Implemented Web3Auth for social login and auto-created AA wallets.
Iteratively designed the UI with user feedback, testing on NERO Testnet for functionality.
Challenges We Ran Into
Resolving TypeScript peer dependency conflicts with react-scripts@5.0.1.
Finding the correct @web3auth/modal version due to registry mismatches.
Debugging gasless transaction failures with Paymaster integration.
Ensuring responsive UI across devices while maintaining animations.
What We Learned
Account Abstraction simplifies Web3 onboarding with gas sponsorship.
Dynamic token handling requires robust error management.
Social login reduces friction, enhancing user adoption.
Modern tools like Vite outperform legacy setups like react-scripts.
What's Next
Wave 4 (SocialFi/Gamification): Add a social feed, referral rewards, and in-app mini-games with NFTs by July 2025.
Wave 5 (DeFi Expansion): Introduce staking, token swapping, and multi-chain support by August 2025.
Future Goals: Build a backend for phone/email-to-address mapping, launch a mobile app, and integrate AI-driven payment suggestions.
